8:16 AM

Thankfully I reset my sleep pattern so I got up by 7AM naturally.

I sold my Remarkable 2 so I'm using a piece of paper/pencil I'm sad.

But I've got the Pinetab 2 coming, won't matter if I'm homeless lmao. It is inferior comparably regarding drawing expereince due to display tech/pen but yeah. It would auto complete a widget/box vs. just plain drawing... more power but no palm rejection/pressure-tilt detection... so that part sucks.

RM2 you can write code for it with c++/rust/qt... idk... dumbass here left his 6-fig job with no savings.

Anyway this tool is a step up above using google spreadsheet.

What's nice about it is development driven by need

I'm thinking about avoiding using a DB, since local storage works... DB/API just adds more work.

Anyway I have more things to sell... my prized 3080Ti FE WHY!!! so sad, that's alright I have not played video games much lately and my desktop keeps crashing for some reason while playing games, just freezes

I already sold my carbon x1 ooh man that hurt, now using PBP which is brutal (problematic, very underpowered), awful keyboard and trackpad

It can't even wake up from sleep lmao, anyway I need to start

The time off has been great though, unfortunately I dumped a lot of the time into interviews or writing the CBP tax parser, that took me a few days

I watched all of The Walking dead too... 11 seasons man damn

Basics... tab view, main being a daily "what's coming up next" sort of thing

Other tab is job apps... covering applications and freelance (probably separate tabs actually)

Time just keeps moving forward and job interviews and what not take time

how do you manifest money now? sell things

Trying to freelance but the jobs are so bad or high competition

It's like "Build facebook for $50" like thanks

It's evolution baby, I was at the park and saw these baby fish swimming along in a creek, death nearby (birds)

Be the peak ape and adapt, survive

Unfortunately there is still not a lot of things that have grown... few of these and purple flowers

Was a great day though, other than the wind

I'd be working on my ml-hat-cam project right now/getting the video write to USB working and polishing the autofocus so I can fly tomorrow... but need to job hunt.

Okay headphones on let's go, wait need coffee

8:40 AM

I feel good right now though, vibin' present, sleep is nice

8:49 AM

distracted

9:00 AM

ugh... my fingers are oily

9:05 AM

distracted... I had an idea though I can get a refund on my VR backed project if desperate that's like a month of expenses

lol the title of this repo, that one time I got isekaid as a homeless man

It is fun to build something freely from scratch, but also it feels like grunt work

To build all the parts out

Okay for the daily thing, it'll just be a large textarea

Then job-hunting is an actual crud thing tracked by time/status

9:19 AM

distracted, time for the metal

going for ugly but functional

9:40 AM

starting to get going

crazy looking back at LinkedIn/reached out, 16 in Mar, 17 in Apr... all Sr. Tech lead type which is not me

9:49 AM

recruiter just hit me up now, updating burn rate app since it is missing a lot of info

I will note, I should focus on applying vs. making this app (less time applying)

I have been fortunate that I was not in the "applied to 500 jobs heard nothing back" group but maybe now...

10:04 AM

oof... yeah I'm more f'd than I realize

10:10 AM quick snack break

10:27 AM

back on... got off the call with recruiter, will study up for that tech stack

yeah I am like legit f'd if I don't get anything this month... how do I manifest money from my ass? idk

I was so used to that 6fig income living check to check, I was helping out people (giving away 30% of my income every month last 3 years) but didn't focus on paying down debts/investing/making side income... so I will change that going forward

10:38 AM

distracted

I'm gonna have to start making moves in a couple weeks if I still don't have anything

10:50 AM

<img src="./app-so-far.JPG"/>

the whole point of this app is to keep me motivated/on a schedule

the backing thing is non-refundable ha

I'm losing steam

11:09 AM

damn yeah I feel spent already, just going to go apply to stuff, right it in a notepad for now till I design the job hunting tab, will finish building it tomorrow morning

11:17 AM

spent
